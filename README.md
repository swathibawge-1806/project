### memory project using verilog
## Design Description
The memory is implemented using a register array.
Write operation occurs on the positive edge of the clock when write enable is high.
Read data is provided based on the address input.

## Verification Strategy
- Developed a Verilog testbench
- Applied directed read and write test cases
- Verified correct data storage and retrieval
- Used waveform analysis for debugging

## How to Run Simulation
1. Compile the RTL and testbench files
2. Run the simulation using any Verilog simulator (ModelSim / Icarus Verilog)
3. Observe the waveform to verify read and write operations

## Results
All test cases passed successfully and the memory behaved as expected.

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / Icarus Verilog
- GitHub

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of memory design fundamentals
- Hands-on experience with Verilog coding
- Improved debugging and simulation skills
